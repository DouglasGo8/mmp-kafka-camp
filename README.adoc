== Twitter text to be approved as consumer

****
I intend to use this Twitter feed to get real data streams into an application that will put data into Kafka, after that this data will end up in a ELK stack at the end and this just a POC purpose, to show how Apache Camel shines over code bloat up until languages such Python.
This is no Commercial app and will result in any besides product deployment Twitter data will not be displayed and we will only etract tweets on low, very low terms
